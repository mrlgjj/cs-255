This project documents the creation and launching of DriverPass and its web-based system. DriverPass is a new company who wishes to provide a better experience for student drivers, including a web-based system that provides an interface for the customer. The interface will allow customers to browse and purchase service packages, schedule appointments for driver training, take practice tests, view trainer feedback, and update account information online. At the same time, it will allows users of all relevant roles, including staff and administrators, role-specific access to system data and functions.

In this project, I think I was able to present to the viewer all relevant information needed to understand the workings and requirements of the system, and at the same time speak to any and all relevant viewers or clients in a non-technical way and avoid confusing jargon. 

If I could choose one specifica part of the project and its documents to improve, I would choose the sequence diagram in the UML diagram presentation. I would include the necessary notation of the X for ending the sequence.

The user, in whatever role they function withing the system, must be able to perform the task they need to do in order for the system to fulfill its intended purpose. By designing a system with the user's needs in mind, all relevant parts of the organization can rely on the system to perform for DriverPass and facilitate the business's operations.

I have learned an immense amount by using UML for an overview of the design of software, and feel it is a powerful tool for designing, structuring, and communicating to others how software needs to be built in order to fulfill its intended functions.
